evedec
======
Reads and decrypts Eve Online python files and passes them to uncompyle2 to decompile.
* Doesn't manipulate Eve process. Can be run with or without Eve running.
* Searches for decryption key in the blue.dll file.
* Requires uncompyle2 for actual decompilation.
* Uses multiple processes to speed up decompilation.

Expects a evedec.ini file to specify Eve install location and output directory, e.g.:
```
[main]
eve_path = C:\Program Files (x86)\CCP\EVE\
store_path = ..\
```
Still working as of Jan 2018.
